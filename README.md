# Want to follow the examples and code?
If you want to follow the examples showed in this workshop, make sure you have an updated R version. For this you can check on your R console typing this comand:

> R.Version()$version.string

It's better if you have the `3.5.0` version.

Also you will need to install some packages. Try it with this command:

> install.packages(c("nycflights13", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "dplyr")
